# LearnCode : Java TDD CLI Application

## Author : Jay Ramani

## Getting Started

### **Descripton:**

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application built in Java that mimics the functionality of a tool like Udemy. The purpose of this project is to provide an opportunity to learn and practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) techniques in a practical setting.

The application provides a command-line interface for users to perform various actions, such as adding, buying, and deleting courses. Each feature of the application has been developed using TDD, with unit tests created before the implementation of the feature itself.

This project serves as a learning exercise and provides an opportunity to practice TDD techniques using Java.
